## Introduction

A caching system is a crucial component in computer science and software engineering. It allows for efficient data retrieval by storing frequently accessed data in a fast-access storage space. This project aims to help you understand the core principles of caching and various caching replacement policies.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain what a caching system is and its purpose.
- Understand the concepts of FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), MRU (Most Recently Used), and LFU (Least Frequently Used) caching replacement policies.
- Recognize the limitations of caching systems.

## Requirements

- **Python Scripts**: All code files should be written and executed in Python 3.7.
- **File Format**: Ensure that your code files end with a new line.
- **Shebang Line**: Include `#!/usr/bin/env python3` as the first line in all code files.
- **Coding Style**: Follow the pycodestyle (PEP 8) style guidelines (version 2.5).
- **Executable Files**: All Python files should be executable.
- **File Length**: Ensure your code files are well-structured and not excessively long.
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for all modules, classes, and functions. Use docstrings to explain their purpose and functionality. Ensure docstrings consist of real sentences and meet the specified length requirements.

## Usage

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caching-project.git
