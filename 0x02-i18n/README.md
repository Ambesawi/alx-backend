# i18n in Flask Project

This project is designed to demonstrate internationalization (i18n) in Flask web applications. It covers parametrizing Flask templates to display content in different languages, inferring the correct locale based on various factors, and localizing timestamps to meet user preferences.

## Introduction

In this project, we explore the world of internationalization (i18n) in web applications, focusing on Flask. Internationalization allows web applications to adapt to users' language and regional preferences. This project demonstrates how to achieve this by parametrizing templates, inferring the correct locale, and localizing timestamps.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Implement parametrized Flask templates to display content in different languages.
- Infer the correct locale for a user based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers.
- Localize timestamps to match user preferences.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Python Version**: Python 3.7
- **Coding Style**: Pycodestyle (PEP 8) style (version 2.5)
